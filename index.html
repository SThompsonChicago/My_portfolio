        <img class = mePic src="./assets/Me.png" alt="a picture of me with my wife" align="right"/>
            I am a software developer in training, currently living in Chicago and attending the coding
            bootcamp at Northwestern University. I will complete the program in December 2021.
            I also have a PhD in 
            mathematics, with a background in applications of differential equations
            (including in epidemiology and macroeconomics). I have taught college level mathematics for
            several years, including courses in ordinary and partial differential equations, single and 
            multivariable calculus, linear algebra, statistics and more. For fun, I like to go on 
            bike rides with my wife Kate (pictured with me, on the right).
